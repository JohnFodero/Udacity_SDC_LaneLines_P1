Overview
---
This repository contains code created for the first project in the Udacity Self-Driving car nano degree. In this project we are tasked to detect lane lines on a series of images and videos. This provides a simple implementation (see more details in the writeup.md) of lane detection with Hough transform line creation. This does not satisfy the "challenge" section of the project.

Requirements
---  
This was developed in a Python 3.7 miniconda environment with OpenCV, matplotlib, and numpy among other basic libraries.  
A set of input images and videos are provided. Custom test images can be added.  

Usage
---
Run the P1.ipynb notebook.
Change the image directories to test against different images and videos.
